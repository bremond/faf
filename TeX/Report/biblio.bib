  abstract =	 {A technique for the resolution of degeneracy in an
                  active set method for quadratic programming is
                  described. The approach generalises Fletcher's
                  method (1988) which applies to the LP case. The
                  method is described in terms of a linear
                  complementarity problem tableau, which is seen to
                  provide useful insights. It is shown that the
                  degeneracy procedure only needs to operate when the
                  degenerate constraints are linearly dependent on
                  those in the active set. No significant overheads
                  are incurred by the degeneracy procedure. It is
                  readily implemented in a null space format, and no
                  complications in the matrix algebra are
                  introduced. The guarantees of termination provided
                  by Fletcher's method, extending in particular to the
                  case where round-off error is! present, are
                  preserved in the QP case. It is argued that the
                  technique gives stronger guarantees than are
                  available with other popular methods such as Wolfe's
                  method (1963) or the method of Goldfarb and Idnani
                  (1983). }

                  good approximation for a wide range of everyday
                  phenomena, from the operation of car brakes to
                  walking to rock slides. It is also of vital
                  importance for simulating robots, virtual reality,
                  and realistic animation.  However, correctly
                  modeling rigid-body dynamics with friction is
                  difficult due to a number of discontinuities in the
                  behavior of rigid bodies and the discontinuities
                  inherent in the Coulomb friction law.  This is
                  particularly crucial for handling situations with
                  large coefficients of friction, which can result in
                  paradoxical results known at least since

                  counterexample and cause of controversy ever since,
                  and only recently have there been rigorous
                  mathematical results that show the existence of
                  solutions to his example. The new mathematical
                  developments in rigid-body dynamics have come from
                  several sources: ''sweeping processes'' and the
                  measure differential inclusions of Moreau in the
                  1970s and 1980s, the variational inequality
                  approaches of Duvaut and J.-L. Lions in the 1970s,
                  and the use of complementarity problems to formulate
                  frictional contact problems by L{\"{o}}tstedt in the
                  early 1980s.  However, it wasn't until much more
                  recently that these tools were finally able to
                  produce rigorous results about rigid-body dynamics
                  with Coulomb friction and impulses. (Copyright 2005

                  dynamical Coulomb friction problem in finite
                  dimension with discretized time. The novelty of our
                  approach is to capture and treat directly the
                  friction model as a parametric quadratic
                  optimization problem with second-order cone
                  constraints coupled with a fixed point
                  equation. This intrinsic formulation allows a simple
                  existence proof under reasonable assumptions, as
                  well as a variety of solution algorithms. We study
                  mechanical interpretations of these assumptions,
                  showing in particular that they are actually
                  necessary and sufficient for a basic example similar
                  to the so-called “paradox of Painlevé”. Finally, we
                  present some implementations and experiments to
                  illustrate the practical aspect of our work.},
