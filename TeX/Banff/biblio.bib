abstract = {This paper presents a new formulation of the dynamical Coulomb friction problem in finite dimension with discretized time. The novelty of our approach is to capture and treat directly the friction model as a parametric quadratic optimization problem with second-order cone constraints coupled with a fixed point equation. This intrinsic formulation allows a simple existence proof under reasonable assumptions, as well as a variety of solution algorithms. We study mechanical interpretations of these assumptions, showing in particular that they are actually necessary and sufficient for a basic example similar to the so-called “paradox of Painlevé”. Finally, we present some implementations and experiments to illustrate the practical aspect of our work.},
